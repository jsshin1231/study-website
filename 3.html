<h2>Famous Architects</h2>
<ol>
    <li><h3>Le Corbusier</h3>
        Le Corbusier (Charles-Édouard Jeanneret) is considered as the most important architect of the modern age. He shaped the perceptions of modern architecture and of modernity itself.
        When one looks at Le Corbusier's life's work one can only be astonished at its abundance. Le Corbusier built many groundbreaking buildings around the world and drew up numerous important urban development plans.</li>
    <li><h3>Louis Khan</h3>
        Louis Isadore Kahn was born Itze-Leib Schmuilowsky in 1901 on Osel, an island off the coast of Estonia. His family immigrated to the United States when he was four, settling in Philadelphia, where they had relatives already living nearby. In 1915, upon becoming naturalized citizens, his parents “Americanized” the family’s names, taking the surname Kahn, which had been chosen by a relative who had immigrated earlier.</li>
    <li><h3>Jean Nouvel</h3>
        Jean Nouvel (born August 12, 1945, Fumel, Lot-et-Garonne, France) is a French architect who designed his buildings to “create a visual landscape” that fit their context—sometimes by making them contrast with the surrounding area. </li>
